# Database-Exercise
This was a University coursework project where we had to design and implement a database for a library system. The project included identifying and attributes, and normalising our table design before creation. With the creation of the database we used a combination of standard SQL as well as PL/SQL to implement more complex triggers for automation.

----------README-----------

In this GitHub Repository there are four documents (including this one):

1) ECS740P_COURSEWORK1_GROUP26_CRICK,GIDEY,HUANG,SINGH:
	This is our master document which contains all of our method for creating the database, normalising as well as our creation code which you can run yourself in Oracle Live. 

2) ALLCODEDATABASESCOURSEWORK:
	This contains the entire raw code that can be used to create this database including tables,population,triggers and sequences. This can be copied and pasted directly into Oracle Live in its entirety to create the SQL code. It contains a random amount of data to populate tables with so the database has users, books and other resources from the start. 

3) VIEWSCODE:
	This contains raw code to create the database along with certain queries ensure that when the Views are run, the views show proper data. For instance, pre-made loans, reservations are implemented with this raw code so that the views runs coherently. 
 
4) Readme
IMPORTANT: IF YOU PLAN TO RUN OUR CODE PLEASE ENTER THE CODE IN THE EXACT ORDER ONLY THAT IT IS WRITTEN OUT. EXECUTE EACH BLOCK INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE EXECTUING THE NEXT BLOCK.
EXACT ORDER SHOULD BE CLEAR BUT IF NOT SHOULD BE: TABLES, TABLE POPULATION, SEQUENCES, TRIGGERS, QUERIES, VIEWS.
